# Week 1

## Lab 02

### About Me

The html of this website is an about me page. There is minimal CSS at the moment. The JS for this site is a guessing game the user plays before accessing the html. The game consists of 5  yes or no questions. The user can answer with 'yes', 'y', 'no', 'y'. The string entered will be lowecased and trimmed, so there is more usability. If the user enters and invalid answer, an error message will appear and the questions will continue.

#### Reflections and Comments

I didn't learn much new using this lab. I got a lot of good review. I did realize how useful functions will be when we start using them. I wrote so many if/else statements that could have been replaced with a function that takes parameters. I did learn/realize how useful comments can be. It made my code so much more readable and more appealing to look at. It was really good for me to review these concepts. I had forgot how to link the different files together. I suppose I did learn a few things this lab. I didn't know that you could create an invisible file. I also didn't know that you could create rules using the .json file. I also learned that you need to reset the CSS so you can remove the browser defaults. I thought it was very interesting that we had to do that. I wonder how useful it will be later on. I also like using the tree command on my terminal. That's not something new for me. I just think it's cool.

## Lab 03

### About Me 03

The html of this website is an about me page. I added a top ten foods list and made my education and work histories lists as well. . The JS for this site is a guessing game the user plays before accessing the html. The game consists of 5  yes or no questions, one qeustion that requires you to guess a number with four attempts, and one question where you have to guess one of my favorite genres of music. The user can answer with 'yes', 'y', 'no', 'y' in the yes or no questions. The user can answer with a number in the number guessing question and a string in the music guessing question. The string entered will be lowecased and trimmed, so there is more usability in both questions 1 through 5 and question 7. In question 6, where you must guess numbers, the string returned by the user is converted to a string.  If the user enters and invalid answer, an error message will appear and the questions/guess attempts will continue.

#### Reflections and Comments 03

- When you reset css everything is reset. There are no heading sizes or list markings.
- `Number()` is a good way to convert a string to a number
- `break;` will only break you out of the current loop. As in if you are in a nested loop, it will break you out of the nested loop and not the nested and the parent loop.
