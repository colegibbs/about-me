## About Me

The html of this website is an about me page. There is minimal CSS at the moment. The JS for this site is a guessing game the user plays before accessing the html. The game consists of 5  yes or no questions. The user can answer with 'yes', 'y', 'no', 'y'. The string entered will be lowecased and trimmed, so there is more usability. If the user enters and invalid answer, an error message will appear and the questions will continue.
