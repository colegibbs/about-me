      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello visitors, my name is Cole Gibbs. I grew up in Snoqualmie, Washington and have lived in Washington my whole life. Before coming to code fellows I was a Chemistry Student and chef. Coding started as a hobby a several months ago. I dedicated more and more time to it until I decided to make it a career. Some of my other hobbies are working out, martial arts, and reading.</p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals right now are fairly simple. My first goal is to graduate from Code Fellows as soon as I can with as much knowledge retained as I can manage. My second goal is a fitness goal. I am into health and fitnes as a hobby and I'm currently working towards a weight gain of 10 lbs of muscle. This means I am lifting weigths and have daily goals for that. I would idealy find a job shortly after graduating from Code Fellows, but that feels very far away right now. Though I'm sure it's closer than it appears to me.</p>
