      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello visitors, my name is Cole Gibbs. I grew up in Snoqualmie, Washington and have lived in Washington my whole life. Before coming to code fellows I was a Chemistry Student and chef. Coding started as a hobby a several months ago. I dedicated more and more time to it until I decided to make it a career. Some of my other hobbies are working out, martial arts, and reading.</p>

      <h2>Educational History</h2>
      <!-- <p>After graduating high school, I moved to Santa Barbra, CA and attended the local college there. Finishing up my first year there I realized California was not for me. I moved back to washington and worked for around a year. I went back to school to get my chemistry degree and got my AA in arts and science with a math and chemistry emphasis. I was about to go to WSU to complete my chemistry degree when I learned about Code Fellows and other school like it. I knew going to a fast track, bootcamp style school was for me. I often found classes in college slow and I knew in a school like Code Fellows I'd be put back on my heels. I decided to join Code Fellows and I have now completed the 101 and 102 courses. I'm excited to continue on with my education into 301 and 401.</p> -->

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals right now are fairly simple. My first goal is to graduate from Code Fellows as soon as I can with as much knowledge retained as I can manage. My second goal is a fitness goal. I am into health and fitnes as a hobby and I'm currently working towards a weight gain of 10 lbs of muscle. This means I am lifting weigths and have daily goals for that. I would idealy find a job shortly after graduating from Code Fellows, but that feels very far away right now. Though I'm sure it's closer than it appears to me.</p>
